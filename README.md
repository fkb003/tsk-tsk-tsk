Did you do your tasks?

## Goal:
I want this to be a hackable and extensible to-do list app

## How to use:
* Type anything to add it as a task under the currently selected list
* Use this syntax to create a new list: +listname
* To select list at position n type: @n
* To select list by name: @listname
* To mark a task at position n in the current list as 'done' type: .n
* To mark a task at position n in the current list as 'skipped' type: #n

## How to install:
1. Clone the repository (or download and extract it)
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal
3. Run the 'main.py' file: `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

## Next feature I'm planning to implement:
- Memory permanence (A database)
